['Our method, therefore, reduces the amount of neurons in the first layer and minimizes the number of parameters during the training phase; thus, we demonstrate a practical advantage of reducing the number of neurons in a CNN without reducing the computational footprint of the model. The number of parameters in a CNN without reducing the computational footprint is shown to be reduced proportionally to the number of neurons in the public domain. First, the reduction of memory constraints is shown to be very efficient during the training phase; therefore, we propose a practical advantage of reducing the number of neurons in the first layer. These methods are also more efficient than the standard methods of reducing the memory footprint of the model, which limits the efficiency of the training process to the extent that it is not possible to reduce the number of parameters of the network. Therefore, we propose a new approach to reduce the number of parameters in a CNN without reducing the computational footprint of the model. The number of neurons in the first layer is shown to be reduced proportionally to the number of neurons in the public domain; thus, we demonstrate a practical advantage of reducing the number of neurons in a CNN without reducing the computational footprint of the model.']
